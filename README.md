# Smart Speed Controller

The Smart Speed Controller is a Chrome extension that enhances your YouTube watching experience by dynamically adjusting the playback speed based on the complexity of the content being spoken in the video. This extension aims to make video consumption more efficient and enjoyable by automatically speeding up boring and simple sections while allowing complex parts to play at a normal pace.

Simple and repetitive sections are sped up, allowing you to save time, while important and complex parts play at normal speed to ensure comprehension.
